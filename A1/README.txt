1) who is in your group? 
Shiying Xu (sx69)
Qian Qiao (qq22)
2) how can you two devide the workload?
We divided the workload by splitting the 8 functions in graph.cpp in two. Qian Qiao did the first four functions, and I did the last four functions.
We also divided the 8 event handlers into the same two parts.
We debugged together.
