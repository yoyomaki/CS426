1) who is in your group? 
Shiying Xu (sx69)
Qian Qiao (qq22)
2) how can you two devide the workload?
For lab 1:
We divided the workload by splitting the 8 functions in graph.cpp in two. Qian Qiao did the first four functions, and I did the last four functions.
We also divided the 8 event handlers into the same two parts.
We debugged together.

For lab 2:
First we discussed how the process is different from lab 1 and designed the structure for the super block, log page and checkpoint.
Qian Qiao wrote the framework and the logic of the code, and I added detailed to each method.
We also split the write log, she responsibled for the nodes and I responsibled for the edges.
We debugged together.
